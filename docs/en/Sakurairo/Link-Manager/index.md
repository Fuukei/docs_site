# Link Management <Badge type="tip" text="v3.0" />

You can access the Link Management page from **Dashboard → Links → Link Status**.

## Link Status:

The system automatically checks the accessibility of all your links every week. On the Link page, it will display a status indicator:  
- **Green**: Accessible  
- **Red**: Unreachable  

Using network security measures like Five-Second Shields may cause inaccurate status indicators.

## Status Check:

You can manually click **Check All Links Now** to trigger a full status check for all links.  
Clicking **Check Now** next to a specific link will check its accessibility individually.  
Click **Reset Status** to remove the status indicator for that link.  
Click **Edit** to go to the editing page for that link's details.
